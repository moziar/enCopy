# enCopy
A Tampermonkey based script to enable content editable on browser. 
More likely, it's just for fun, so I don't know which website could actually copy by this method.
For now, the tested support website is as follow:
- zhihu.com

### Requirement
- Any browser that support Tampermonky
- tempermonkey installed

### Installation
Just import to Tampermonky
